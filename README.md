# tasktime-be
A back-end for tasktime to-do list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
This back-end uses Node JS, Express JS and Mongoose DB. 
On this back-end we manage a single RESTful API 
for HTTP verbs: get, post, put, patch, delete(remove).

In addition we used middleware to keep the code DRY.
